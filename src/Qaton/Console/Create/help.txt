This module will assist creating Qaton resources such as Controllers, Views,
Models, Pages, Database Migrations, CRUD Dashboards and more.

Usage: 

migration [migration_name(string)] ...

        Create New Migration

        Options:

        --template=[template_path/template(string)]
        Path to a migration template

        --table
        Name of the table to be applied to new migration. This will only work if
        only one model is being created at a time. If multiple models are being
        created, a table name will be generated automatically for each table
        (which may result in an undesired table name). The automated table name
        generation is meant for demonstration only and not intended to actually
        figure out what you need. 

model [model_path/model_name(string)] ...

        Create New Migration

        Options:

        --template=[template_path/template(string)]
        Path to a migration template

        --migration
        Also create a migration file for each model 

        --table
        Name of the table to be applied to new model. This will only work if
        only one model is being created at a time. If multiple migrations are
        being created, a table name will be generated automatically for each
        table (which may result in an undesired table name). The automated table
        name generation is meant for demonstration only and not intended to
        actually figure out what you need. If you use the migration flag, the
        same name will be generated for the migration as well.

controller [controller_path/controller_name(string)] ...
                
        Create New Controller

        Options: 

        --view 
        Generates a view along with the controller. If the --clean option is NOT
        used together with this, then Qaton will also add a render reference in
        the Controller constructor.

        --template:[layout_name=template_path/template_name(string)] 
        Looks in the App/Templates/ directory for the controller template to
        use. This option overrides and ignores the --clean option if executed
        together.

view [view_path/view_name(string)] ...
                
        Create New View

        Options: 

        --template:[layout_name=template_path/template_name(string)]
        Looks in the App/Templates/ directory for the view template to use This
        option overrides and ignores the --clean option if executed together.

page [page_path/page_name(string)]

        Create New Page. Pages are a pre-configured combination of Views and
        Controllers organized by layout and template logic. This command exists
        to help create web pages quickly using the Qaton CLI. Default layout and
        template logic is copied from the Qaton core upon first use into user
        editable space within the App. This logic is then used in all subsequent
        Page creations.
